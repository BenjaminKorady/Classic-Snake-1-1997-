    //  Pick the smaller number to make cells square and ensure they fit in both X and Y.
    //  So 40x40 px would be the maximum cell size

    //  So the game frame on the X-axis fills 20 cells of 3x3 pixels (20x3), each separated by
    //  a single pixel (20*3 + 19*1). The frame itself is 1 pixel wide on each side 
    //  (20*3 + 19*1 + 2) and the frame is also separated from the cells by 1 pixel on each

    //  As the PC screen resolution is much larger than the old phones' resolution. The actual PC
    //  pixels are smaller to the human eye and playing on a 83x47 resolution would be nothing special.
    //  So we create a sort of "large pixel". What seems like 1 pixel on the phone, will be more pixels
    //  on the PC monitor. The largest possible value for each pixel would be:
    //  (800 / 83) which is approximately 9.64 so to round it up: 1 phone pixel = 9 PC monitor pixels

    //  If you look at the phone screen, the pixels are not right next to each other and are actually
    //  separated by a small space:
    //  http://i.imgur.com/pvGfdoS.png
    //  Here I experimented a bit and just tried what looked the best. 3 was too big of a space, 1 seemed too small
    //  So 2 pixels it was!
	static constexpr int LARGE_PIXEL_OFFSET = 2;   

    //  This means that the actual large pixel's dimension will be LARGE_PIXEL_DIMENSION - LARGE_PIXEL_OFFSET = ( 9 - 2 )

    //  (7+2) * (7+2)

	static constexpr int unusedPixelsY = SCREEN_HEIGHT - (LARGE_PIXEL_DIMENSION) * GRID_HEIGHT; //177
